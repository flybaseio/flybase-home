				<h3>The Little Real-time Web Development Book</h3>
			</div>
			<p>This book is the first Flybase centric book, and is a book we've enjoyed working on.</p>
			<p>The Little Real-time Web Development Book is a guide for beginner - to intermediate-level web developers looking to take the next leap forward in website and app development: real-time.</p>
			<p>With The Little Real-time Web Development Book, you'll be able to quickly get up to speed on what HTML5 WebSocket does, how it is going to affect the future of the web as we know it, and—thanks to Flybase's flexible API—start developing your first real-time app today.</p>
			<p>The Little Real-time Web Development Book will guide you through building your first app using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular.js, Node.js, and the Flybase API.</p>
			<p>After your initial introduction to the technologies used in the book, you'll immediately jump into the process of creating a real-time social news app, complete with posting, voting and commenting.</p>

				<h3>The Growth Hacking List</h3>
			</div>
<p>I've built several blogs and startups over the years, and as I've built them, I've collected tips from all over the Internet (from books, blogs, articles, videos, podcasts, news, and comments) for the best growth hacks, each of which has been tested in my startups. </p>

<p>I started keeping these growth hacks in a short form and keeping them in a private wiki page. And then I had an idea: Why not put these into a book so that others can have them readily available too?</p>

<p>This book contains all the top growth hacks that I've tested and implemented and proven to work. </p>

<p>These growth hacks are divided into handy sections: Before Product / Market Fit, Hustling, Copywriting, Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral</p>

<p>As more growth hacks are added, then more growth hacks will get added to this book.</p>
