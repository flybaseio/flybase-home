				<h3>The Little Real-time Web Development Book</h3>
			</div>
			<p>This book is the first Flybase centric book, and is a book we've enjoyed working on.</p>
			<p>The Little Real-time Web Development Book is a guide for beginner - to intermediate-level web developers looking to take the next leap forward in website and app development: real-time.</p>
			<p>With The Little Real-time Web Development Book, you'll be able to quickly get up to speed on what HTML5 WebSocket does, how it is going to affect the future of the web as we know it, and—thanks to Flybase's flexible API—start developing your first real-time app today.</p>
			<p>The Little Real-time Web Development Book will guide you through building your first app using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Angular.js, Node.js, and the Flybase API.</p>
			<p>After your initial introduction to the technologies used in the book, you'll immediately jump into the process of creating a real-time social news app, complete with posting, voting and commenting.</p>
