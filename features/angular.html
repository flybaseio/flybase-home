		<h2><i class="fa fa-key"></i> Security & User Management</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
		Flybase provides a rich set of out-of-the-box security and user management features, including social login
		(such as Facebook and Google+) and more.
	</p>
	<p>All of your data is transferred over a secure SSL connection with a 2048-bit certificate. Database access and validation is controlled using our API key rules.</p>
	<hr />
	<h3>API Keys</h3>
	<p>Flybase allows you to restrict reading and writing via custom access controls, authentication and IP whitelisting.</p>
	<p>Access to apps are controlled by API keys that are granted with a certain set of permissions. API keys determine which apps you can access and what you can do with them. They must be created from inside your account.</p>

	<p>A default API key is automatically created and available for you in your application dashboard.</p>

	<h3>Permissions</h3>

	<p>API keys grant a different set of permissions according to their level of privileges:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Admin: allow any operation on an application</li>
		<li>Read-Only: give only read access to an app as well as the ability to create new documents</li>
		<li>API Keys can be whitelisted to allow access from certain domains or IP addresses only</li>
	</ul>
	<p>On top of that, all data is replicated and backed up to multiple secure locations.</p>
