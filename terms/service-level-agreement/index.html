<h5>Effective Date: December 5, 2014</h5>

<p>
This Flybase Service Level Agreement ("SLA") is a policy governing the use of Flybase cloud-based services 
("Flybase Services") under the terms of the <a href="/terms/terms-of-service">Flybase Terms of Service</a> (the "Terms of Service") between 
Flybase ("Flybase", "us" or "we") and users of Flybase Services ("you"). This SLA applies 
separately to each account using Flybase Services. Unless otherwise provided herein, this SLA is subject 
to the terms of the Terms of Service.  Flybase reserves the right to change the terms of this SLA 
in accordance with the Terms of Service.
</p>

<h4>1. Service Commitment</h4>

<p>
Flybase will use commercially reasonable efforts to make Flybase instances available with a 
Monthly Uptime Percentage (defined below) of at least 99.95%, in each case during any monthly billing cycle 
(the "Service Commitment"). In the event Flybase does not meet the Service Commitment, you will be 
eligible to receive a Service Credit as described below.
</p>

<h4>2. Definitions</h4>

<p>
The following capitalized terms shall be given the meaning set forth below:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>"Monthly Uptime Percentage"</strong> is calculated by subtracting from 100% the percentage of continuous 5 minute periods 
  during the month in which a Flybase instance was in a state of "Unavailable." Monthly Uptime Percentage 
  measurements exclude downtime resulting directly or indirectly from any Flybase SLA Exclusion (defined below).
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>"Unavailable"</strong> and <strong>"Unavailability"</strong> means when a running Flybase instance has no external connectivity.
  </li>

  <li>
    A <strong>"Service Credit"</strong> is a dollar credit, calculated as set forth below, that we may credit back to an eligible account.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Service Commitments and Service Credits</h4>
<p>
Service Credits are calculated as a percentage of the total charges paid by you (excluding one-time payments 
such as upfront payments) for a Flybase instance for the monthly billing cycle in which the Unavailability 
occurred in accordance with the schedule below.
</p>

<table class="table table-bordered">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Monthly Uptime Percentage</th>
      <th>Service Credit Percentage</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>

  <tbody><tr>
    <td>Less than 99.95% but equal to or greater than 99.0%</td>
    <td>10%</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Less than 99.0%</td>
    <td>30%</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
We will apply any Service Credits only against future Flybase payments otherwise due from you. 
At our discretion, we may issue the Service Credit to the credit card you used to pay for the billing 
cycle in which the Unavailability occurred. Service Credits will not entitle you to any refund or other 
payment from Flybase. A Service Credit will be applicable and issued only if the credit amount for 
the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than one dollar ($1 USD). Service Credits may not be 
transferred or applied to any other account. Unless otherwise provided in the Terms of Service, your 
sole and exclusive remedy for any unavailability, non-performance, or other failure by us to provide 
Flybase Services is the receipt of a Service Credit (if eligible) in accordance with the terms of this SLA.
</p>

<h4>4. Credit Request and Payment Procedures</h4>

<p>
To receive a Service Credit, you must submit a claim by sending an email to support@flybase.io. 
To be eligible, the credit request must be received by us by the end of the second billing cycle 
after which the incident occurred and must include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>i. the words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line;</li>

  <li>ii. the dates and times of each Unavailability incident that you are claiming;</li>

  <li>iii. the affected Flybase instance urls; and</li>

  <li>iv. your request logs that document the errors and corroborate your claimed outage (any confidential or sensitive information in these logs should be removed or replaced with asterisks).</li>
</ul>

<p>
If the Monthly Uptime Percentage of such request is confirmed by us and is less than the Service Commitment, 
then we will issue the Service Credit to you within one billing cycle following the month in which your 
request is confirmed by us. Your failure to provide the request and other information as required 
above will disqualify you from receiving a Service Credit. 
</p>

<h4>5. Flybase SLA Exclusions</h4>

<p>
The Service Commitment does not apply to any unavailability, suspension or termination of 
Flybase Services, or any other Flybase or Flybase Services performance issues: (i) caused 
by factors outside of our reasonable control, including, without limitation, any force majeure 
event or Internet access or related problems beyond the demarcation point of Flybase Services or 
its direct hosting subcontractors (i.e beyond the point in the network where Flybase maintains 
access and control over the Flybase Services); (ii) that result from any actions or inactions of 
you or any third party (other than Flybaseâ€™s direct hosting subcontractor); (iii) that result from your equipment, software or other technology 
and/or third party equipment, software or other technology (other than third party equipment within 
our direct control); (iv) that result from any scheduled maintenance; or (vi) arising from our 
suspension and termination of your right to use Flybase Services in connection with any breach by 
you of the Terms of Service or otherwise in accordance with the Terms of Service 
(collectively, the "Flybase SLA Exclusions"). If availability is impacted by factors other than those used in 
our Monthly Uptime Percentage calculation, then we may issue a Service Credit considering such factors at our discretion.
