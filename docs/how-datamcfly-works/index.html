<div class="well">
	<p>Building an application is full of tedious and difficult tasks. Nearly every app needs a database, an API, and authentication. With Flybase — all of this is done for you. Our mission at Flybase is to enable you to build extraordinary experiences.</p>

		<h3>Save data in the cloud</h3>
		<p>
			A Flybase <strong>App</strong> itself is your real-time database, hosted in the
			cloud. Since Flybase is a NoSQL database you can easily store data as simple
			JSON documents.
		</p>
		<p>
			Our servers are optimized for extremely low latencies. Flybase is fast enough
			for high performance real-time applications like multiplayer games.
			We maintain persistent connections between your clients and our servers so
			that data synchronizes both directions without delay. You can expect typical
			network latencies (less than 100ms) for data updates between clients.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="docs-section">
		<h3>Real-time Data</h3>
		<p>
			Flybase isn't just an API though. After data is stored in your App it gets streamed in real-time to every 
			connected client. This means that Flybase automatically updates all clients with the newest set of data.
		</p>
		<p>
			Flybase isn't just for real-time apps, <strong>it is for anybody that wants to write apps without having to run backend servers or write server code</strong>. Many developers prefer focusing on front end rather than building, deploying, and maintaining server-side backend code. Even if real-time isn’t critical to your application, Flybase can help you build your application faster and scale seamlessly.
		</p>
	
	</div>
	<div class="docs-section">
		<h3>Instant Scalability</h3>
		<p>
			Flybase manages millions of concurrent connections and billions of operations.
			When your app is a breakout hit you don't have to scramble to provision extra
			capacity or worry about if your server code will scale.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="docs-section">
		<h3>API Keys</h3>

		<p>Access to apps are controlled by API keys that are granted with a certain set of permissions. API keys determine which apps you can access and what you can do with them. They must be created from inside your account.</p>

		<p>A default API key is automatically created and available for you in your application dashboard.</p>
		
		<h3>Permissions</h3>

		<p>API keys grant a different set of permissions according to their level of privileges:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Admin: allow any operation on an application</li>
			<li>Read-Only: give only read access to an app as well as the ability to create new documents</li>
		</ul>
