	<h3>Understanding Security</h3>

	<p>Security is a really big topic, and it's very important. Traditionally, it has been one of the most difficult parts of app development. Flybase makes it a whole lot easier to secure your app. We take care of some parts entirely. Where we can't handle something completely, we simplify. For example, we provide a tool for whitelisting IPs and domains that can access your apps, and also for creating API Keys that only have certain permissions.</p>
	
	<p>This page describes how to build secure apps on Flybase. Flybase apps run more client-side code than those with many other technology stacks. Therefore, the way we approach security may be a bit different than you're used to.</p>
