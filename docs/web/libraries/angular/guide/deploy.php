	<h3>Deploying Your App</h3>
	<hr />
	<p>Your awesome Flybase app is almost ready to go into production! Before you put it out into the world, there are four important things you need to do:</p>
</div>


<?php
/*
<div class="docs-section">
	<h3>Secure Your App</h3>
	
	<p>
	Using our flexible Security and Flybase Rules language, you can easily define which users have read and write access to different parts of your appâ€™s data. You can edit and test your rules directly in your Flybase Dashboard by clicking on the <strong>Security &amp; Rules</strong> tab. If you haven't added rules yet, check out the <a href="/docs/web/guide/understanding-security.html">Security section</a> of the guide to get started.
	</p>
	
	<div class="alert alert-error full-width">Without Security and Flybase Rules, your Flybase is globally writable and readable through the API.</div>
</div>

<div class="docs-section">
	<h3>Hosting Your Website</h3>
	
	<p>
		There are a few options for deploying your Flybase app:
	</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Our hosting service, <a href="/hosting.html">Flybase Hosting</a>, lets you deploy static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.) to your own domain. It's CDN-backed and served over a secure SSL connection. Check out our <a href="/docs/hosting/quickstart.html">Hosting Quickstart Guide</a> to get started.</li>
		<li>If your Flybase app has server-side scripts, there are a variety of third-party hosting services you can use.</li>
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="docs-section">
	<h3>Whitelist Your Domain for Authentication</h3>
	
	<p>
		If you're using any authentication methods other than custom tokens in your app, make sure to whitelist your domain so that it can make login requests. All Flybases have <code>localhost</code> and <code>127.0.0.1</code> enabled by default. To add your domain, navigate to the <strong>Login &amp; Auth</strong> tab on your Flybase Dashboard and add your domain under <strong>Authorized Request Origins</strong>.
	</p>
</div>


<div class="docs-section">
	<h3>Upgrade Your Flybase Plan</h3>
	
	<p>
		Our Hacker Plan allows up to 50 concurrent connections, or simultaneous users on your application. If 50 users are currently connected and a 51st user attempts to connect to your app, the API will throw an error and any additional connections will fail. All of our <a href="/pricing/">paid plans</a> have no hard caps on usage and are recommended for production apps.
	</p>
