	<p>Keeping data synced across multiple devices, people and apps is hard. Flybase was created out of the many lessons that have been learnt while building and scaling online services.</p>
</div>
	
<p>The first API that would eventually grow into what Flybase is now was originally developed in 2013, when after making yet another mobile app and API for a client, we realized that we were basically making the same API for each client, <em class="blue">the difference was the data</em>. We were building the same API for each app, and changing the data being used to match what was needed.</p>

<p>From there, grew a large, almost overwhelming desire to build a universal, flexible API that could be used on any type of app to handle data storage and synchronize in real-time across multiple devices.</p>

<p>Now, fast forward to 2017, and Flybase is helping thousands of developers quickly and easily build apps in in double time, with the Flybase cloud servers acting as their appâ€™s backend.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you are a developer in a big company or a small startup, we want to help you build software that is both fun to write and a joy to use. Our easy-to-use API (REST or real-time with GraphQL launching shortly) lets developers store data that is automatically synchronized to the Flybase cloud servers; and from our servers to any other clients that are listening for changes on that data.</p>

<p> This allows for rapidly building fast data-driven software that updates in real-time across multiple devices.</p>

<h3>Where are you guys located?</h3>

<p>Flybase is a Canadian-owned company and proud of it. We are also a remote company with people spread out all over, but our primary HQ is located in Penticton, deep in the Okanagan valley of British Columbia, Canada.</p>

<p>We are around a 40 minute plane right from Vancouver, Seattle or Calgary and love this location for being the most unique climate in Canada.</p>

<p>Surrounded by hundreds of wineries, this is one of the few places in the country where you can go skiing on a Saturday morning in the mountains and Paddle boarding at the lake in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Wait a minute, didn't you guys used to be called Data McFly?</h3>
<p>Yes we did, and Data McFly is still around as our parent company, but we've decided to grow our main product as Flybase</p>
