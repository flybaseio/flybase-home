	<p>Keeping data synced across multiple devices, people and apps is hard. Flybase was created out of the many lessons that have been learnt while building and scaling online services.</p>
</div>
	
<p>The first API that would eventually grow into what Flybase is now was originally developed in 2013, when after making yet another mobile app and API for a client, we realized that we were basically making the same API for each client, <em class="blue">the difference was the data</em>. We were building the same API for each app, and changing the data being used to match what was needed.</p>

<p>From there, grew a large, almost overwhelming desire to build a universal, flexible API that could be used on any type of app to handle data storage and synchronize in real-time across multiple devices.</p>

<p>Now, fast forward to 2015, and Flybase helps developers quickly and easily build apps in less time than it used to take, with the Flybase cloud servers acting as your appâ€™s backend.</p>

<p>It doesn't matter if you are a developer in a big company or a small startup, we want to help you build software that is both fun to write and a joy to use. Our easy-to-use REST API lets developers store data that is  automatically synchronized to the Flybase cloud servers; and from our servers to any other clients that are listening for changes on that data.</p>

<p> This allows for rapidly building fast data-driven software that updates in real-time across multiple devices.</p>

<h3>Wait a minute, didn't you guys used to be called Data McFly?</h3>
<p>Yes we did, and Data McFly is still around as our parent company, but we've decided to grow our main product as Flybase</p>
